TO DO:
	- Rewrite MotionController
	- Optimise setting transformation to ISceneNode in SceneNode code
	- Optimise loading and creating Entities
	- Optimise btCollisionShape and CollisionShape - make a map inside
			CollisionShape: (scale) -> btCollisionShape
			(to avoid exact copies of btCollisionShape)
		* add CollisionShape::GetNewBtCollisionShape(scale);
			// not necessery uniqe, get by scale
		* add CollisionShape::SetScale(btCollisionShape, newScale);
			// if current btCollisionShape is unique, change it's scale;
			// else if it's not unique,
			// call CollisionShape::GetNewBtCollisionShape(newScale);
	- Official cases:
		* create documentation (for v1.0.0)
		* update ChangeLog.txt
		* update Readme.txt linux compilation section
		* choose a license
		* update Dependencies.txt for linux
	- Saving and loading Entities, SceneNodes from JSON or with using scripts
	- Correct MotionController varying jump height
	- Make explicit instance of btCollisionObject in StaticEntity, btRigidBody
			in DynamicEntity, btGhostObject in Trigger, and remove
			btCollisionObject*Entity::body
	- Add void Entity::SetPhysicsEnabled(bool),
			void Entity::SetCollisionEnabled(bool) (and getters for them)
	- Add bool Entity::EverNeedTick() const and separate lists of objects that
			needs frequent/rare/none updates to reduce engine tick time
	- Use Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/) consistently
	- Update Readme.txt
	- Code refactor - reorder methods in classes to be consecutive and keep
			that order in *.cpp files
	- Code refactor - update to my new code style
	- Code refactor - update license dates and licenes
	- Code refactor - make classes smaller, split it's tasks to smaller classes
	- Code refactor - change position of asterisk (*) and ampersand (&)
			when declaring variables, members or arguments
	- Code refactor - rename header files *.h to *.hpp
	- Code refactor - move updating entities to Simulation class
	- Code refactor - move mouse lock to event receiver irrlicht
	- Add map files, loading game state, saving game state with/as scripts
	- Add error validation to script parser
	- Update StringToEnter class to have ctrl+arrows/delete/backspace editor
			and other essential stuff
	- Update Console to show cursor position
	- Change MESSAGE macro to a class which manages logs, timestamps, etc.
	- Add HUD class
	- Correct GUI class which does not respects it's workspace
	- Window::Draw is not stable on windows which causes lags (sometimes render
			takes ~30-40 ms without no reason with stable average 4ms tick). It
			mostly causes lags with mouse (it somtimes looks lik previous jiggly
			mouse movement).
	- Change sequence sing::engine->AddEntity(sing::entityFactory->AddEntity(
			...)) to somthing cleaner
	- Remove game/Event class and mov it's content to Menu/HUD
	- Change starting menus by class template to starting by registered name
			(similarily to ClassFactory for entities)
	- Make GUI namespace and change GUI class to GUI::Renderer class, and add
			GUI::Workspace class as text-workspace
	

TO DO (to think/code restructuring):
	- Mesh class resource (combination of graphical model and it's LOD,
			collision shape); possibly replacement for SceneNode
	- Remove GetVersion.cpp
	- Font resource class
	- Replace bullet physics engine with simple box/sphere/triangle
			parallel collision detection
	- Change structure of threads: Renderer, Command/Script Issuer,
			Update Threads, Collision Thread;
			Design no-blocking threads communication, use std::shared_mutex for
			thread pool
	

Done:
	- Makefile (and binaries?) for linux
	- Using compressed files
	- Decoding ogg sound files
	- Entity-derived classes and other class reorganisation, move from game\*
			to engine\*:
		* StaticEntity
		* DynamicEntity
		* Trigger
		* CharacterWalkTrigger -> MotionControllerTrigger
		* MotionController
	- Multiple Entity-derived classes in one module
	- Sounds
	- Animations
	- Loading archives from irrlicht file system
	- enable window resizing with fov and aspect correction
	- ResourceManager - garbage collecor
	- Model class resource, integrate it with ResourceManager
	- Better ray tracing
	- Sound (previously SoundSampler) as resource and integrate it with
			ResourceManager
	- Material resource class
	- Configurations in json files
	- Rewrite collision shape and collision shape constructor (combine them
			into one class) - make CollisionShape resource;
			remove CollisionShapeManager and use ResourceManager instead
	- Texture resource class, and use it while loading material
	- FileSystem class and IFile and OFile class for unified file access
	- High resolution clock for frame delta time
	- Limit frame rate
	- Menu system
	- Code refactor - Remove "this->" where possible
	- Code refactor - Replace "std::shared_ptr<Entity>" with "Entity*" and
			"std::shared_ptr<btCollisionObject>" with "btCollisionObject*"
	- Code refactor - Make Engine, World, Window, IrrlichtDevice, IVideoDriver,
			ISceneManager, IGUIEnvironmentm, FileSystem, SoundEngine,
			ResourceManager instances as singletons and remove every references
	- Make WAVLoadFromFile to use sing::fileSystem
	- Replace (std::string)Entity::name by (uint64_t)Entity::id
	- All destroying Entities in destructor
	- All constructing/spawning Entities in constructor
	- Creating Entities from JSON
	- Add ResourceManager:GetResource(JSON), Resource::GetJSON(JSON)
			(remove other constructors), Resource::Resource(JSON)
	- Character is based on DynamicEntity
	- Remove Entity::camera
	- Add self-choosing os in Makefile
	- Replace RapidJSON and it's wrapper with github.com/Drwalin/JSON.git
			submodule in dependencies/JSON
	- Change void GetJSON(JSON&) const to JSON GetJSON() const
	- Replace explicit DllLoader code and replace it with
			github.com/Drwalin/DllLoader.git submodule in dep/DllLoader
	- Add custom scripts interpreter to control gameplay and add native-script
			(loaded from shared object) and scripts written in files, it can be
			used to add in-game console and to modify objects/game state
	- Add scroll bar to console
	- Code refactor - added Thread class which controlls parallel to draw tick
	- Code refactor - split code files into multiple directories by category and
			move file *.h/*.hpp and *.cpp to the same directory
	- Code refactor - clean up parallel processing code
	

TO DO in future:
	- MotionController steps on staircase or low objects
	- NavMesh
	- Light maps
	- Dynamic light maps
	- Sound occlusion
	- Mesh occlusion
	- Lights
	- Particles
	- LOD system
	- Sprites in world space
	- Optimise rendering?
	- Limit number of active OpenAL sound sources (choose closest and loudest
			sources - eg. order and enable by distance/volume)
	- Make Ogg to use sing::fileSystem
	- Video player (maybe from *.png image sequence and *.ogg sound file)
	- Multiplayer:
		* divide code sections: server side and client side
		* internet connection:
			TCP - initialization, events, lossless informations
			UDP - streaming entities transofrmation, movement and animation
					informations in realtime
	- Add TryBox and TryCylinder to ObjToShapeConverter
	

Bugs:
	- When entering low-roofed place with very quick crouch-key press then
			character behaves like standing still
	- Executable once crashed whole system (needed to cut power to do anything)
			(in v0.3.1a)
	- Sometimes undefined coordinates of player while starting game (randomly)
			(didn't met since v0.4.1)
	- When pressed Exit Game button, game crashed (only one time) (v0.5.0-k)
	- fprintf(stder,...) in Event::KeyPressedEvent while pressing 'T' to print
			number of objects in world, crashes since [commit SHA-1:
			e684b9ee8ba92cc0a29b4ca2e774f0db7ed59098] - temporarilly replaced
			with std::cout which does not cause problems
	- Sometimes invalid coordinates of Player in the begining (NaN/Inf) spotted
			again in [commit SHA-1: ac76263793df94e73d7415d81cb62aec0021682a]
	- Game crashed few times on Windows OS in [commit SHA-1:
			12fe67f2b4ae7fec2c2114ba21411c7ad3b8a1c5], no reason found.
	

Removed bugs:
	- Removing entity does not remove a ISceneNode
	- When resource manager removes a Resource -> destructor is not called
	- When starting MainMenu at beginig, simulation is not paused
	- Crashed when raytesting for destroying Entities, randomly (v0.5.0-e)
	- Very unstable fps (since v0.4.0) - only feeling of game is unstable, but
			actual frame times are good - corrected in v0.5.0-e by removing
			smoothing frametime between two frames
	- When in game pressed ESC, then pressed RMB/LMB and then pressed ESC to
			return to game, instantly Event spawns multiple boxes/spheres
			(atleast since v0.5.0-k)
	- Correct jiggly mouse movement while mouse is locked
	

To test:
	- Overall test
	- Add many Entities per second and destroy them to find out any memory leaks
			(valgrind) and memory usage
	

Done tests:
	- ResourceManager garbage collector
	- JSON wrapper
