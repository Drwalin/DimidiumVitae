Testing/debugging/bugs:
	CollisionShapeConstructor::Clone
	When entering low-roofed place with very short crouch-key press then character behaves like standing still
	Executable once locked whole system (needed to cut power to do anything)
	Sometimes undefined coordinates while starting game (randomly)
	

TODO:
	Saving and loading Entities, SceneNodes, btCollisionObjects, btCollisionShapes from JSON
	Particles
	NavMesh
	Multiplayer:
		divide code sections for: server side or client side
		internet connection:
			TCP - initialization, events, lossless informations
			UDP - streaming entities transofrmation, movement and animation informations in realtime
	Add menu
	

TODO in future:
	MotionController steps on staircase or low objects
	

In progress:
	ResourceManager:
		garbage collector
		make sound resource
		make texture resource
		make graphical model resource
		make collision shape constructor resource
		make collision shape resource
		make mesh resource (combination of graphical model, collision shape constructor, collision shape)
	

Pre-alpha features:
	Light maps
	Dynamic light maps
	Sound occlusion
	

Done:
	Makefile (and binaries?) for linux
	Using compressed files
	Decoding ogg sound files
	Entity-derived classes and other class reorganisation, move from game\* to engine\*:
		StaticEntity
		DynamicEntity
		Trigger
		CharacterWalkTrigger -> MotionControllerTrigger
		MotionController
	Multiple Entity-derived classes in one module
	Sounds
	Animations
	Loading archives from irrlicht file system
	enable window resizing with fov and aspect correction
