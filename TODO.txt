Testing/debugging/bugs:
	CollisionShapeConstructor::Clone
	When entering low-roofed place with very short crouch-key press then character behaves like standing still
	Executable once locked whole system (needed to cut power to do anything)
	

Features:
	Archives loader
	Saving and loading Entities, SceneNodes, btCollisionObjects, btCollisionShapes from std::iostream
	Particles
	

Pre-alpha features:
	Light maps

	Decoding ogg sound files
	Entity-derived classes and other class reorganisation, move from game\* to engine\*:
		StaticEntity
		DynamicEntity
		Trigger
		CharacterWalkTrigger -> MotionControllerTrigger
		MotionController
