TO DO:
	Rewrite MotionController
	Optimise setting transformation to ISceneNode in SceneNode code
	Optimise loading and creating Entities
	Optimise btCollisionShape and CollisionShape - make a map inside CollisionShape: (scale) -> btCollisionShape (to avoid exact copies of btCollisionShape)
		- add CollisionShape::GetNewBtCollisionShape(scale); // not necessery uniqe, get by scale
		- add CollisionShape::SetScale(btCollisionShape, newScale); // if current btCollisionShape is unique, change it's scale; else if it's not unique, call CollisionShape::GetNewBtCollisionShape(newScale);
	Official cases:
		- create documentation (for v1.0.0)
		- update ChangeLog.txt
		- update Readme.txt linux compilation section
		- choose a license
		- update Dependencies.txt for linux
	Map loading system from JSON
	Saving and loading Entities, SceneNodes from JSON
	Correct MotionController varying jump height
	Make exmplicit instance of btCollisionObject in StaticEntity, btRigidBody in DynamicEntity, btGhostObject in Trigger, and remove btCollisionObject*Entity::body
	Add void Entity::SetPhysicsEnabled(bool), void Entity::SetCollisionEnabled(bool) (and getters for them)
	Add initializer list constructor for JSON
	Add bool Entity::EverNeedTick() const
	Correct jiggly mouse movement while mouse is locked
	Use Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/) consistently
	Add self-choosing os in Makefile
	Replace RapidJSON and it's wrapper with github.com/Drwalin/JSON.git submodule in dependencies/JSON
	Replace explicit DllLoader code and replace it with github.com/Drwalin/DllLoader.git submodule in dependencies/DllLoader
	
	

TO DO (to think/code restructuring):
	Mesh class resource (combination of graphical model and it's LOD, collision shape); possibly replacement for SceneNode
	Code refactor - Reorder methods in classes to be consecutive and keep that order in *.cpp files
	Remove GetVersion.cpp
	Font resource class
	

Done:
	Makefile (and binaries?) for linux
	Using compressed files
	Decoding ogg sound files
	Entity-derived classes and other class reorganisation, move from game\* to engine\*:
		StaticEntity
		DynamicEntity
		Trigger
		CharacterWalkTrigger -> MotionControllerTrigger
		MotionController
	Multiple Entity-derived classes in one module
	Sounds
	Animations
	Loading archives from irrlicht file system
	enable window resizing with fov and aspect correction
	ResourceManager - garbage collecor
	Model class resource, integrate it with ResourceManager
	Better ray tracing
	Sound (previously SoundSampler) as resource and integrate it with ResourceManager
	Material resource class
	Configurations in json files
	Rewrite collision shape and collision shape constructor (combine them into one class) - make CollisionShape resource; remove CollisionShapeManager and use ResourceManager instead
	Texture resource class, and use it while loading material
	FileSystem class and IFile and OFile class for unified file access
	High resolution clock for frame delta time
	Limit frame rate
	Menu system
	Code refactor - Remove "this->" where possible
	Code refactor - Replace "std::shared_ptr<Entity>" with "Entity*" and "std::shared_ptr<btCollisionObject>" with "btCollisionObject*"
	Code refactor - Make Engine, World, Window, IrrlichtDevice, IVideoDriver, ISceneManager, IGUIEnvironmentm, FileSystem, SoundEngine, ResourceManager instances as singletons and remove every references
	Make WAVLoadFromFile to use sing::fileSystem
	Replace (std::string)Entity::name by (uint64_t)Entity::id
	All destroying Entities in destructor
	All constructing/spawning Entities in constructor
	Creating Entities from JSON
	Add ResourceManager:GetResource(JSON), Resource::GetJSON(JSON) (remove other constructors), Resource::Resource(JSON)
	Character is based on DynamicEntity
	Remove Entity::camera
	

TO DO in future:
	MotionController steps on staircase or low objects
	NavMesh
	Light maps
	Dynamic light maps
	Sound occlusion
	Mesh occlusion
	Lights
	Particles
	LOD system
	Sprites in world space
	Optimise rendering?
	Limit number of active OpenAL sound sources (choose closest and loudest sources - eg. order and enable by distance/volume)
	Make Ogg to use sing::fileSystem
	Video player (maybe from *.png image sequence and *.ogg sound file)
	Multiplayer:
		- divide code sections: server side and client side
		- internet connection:
			TCP - initialization, events, lossless informations
			UDP - streaming entities transofrmation, movement and animation informations in realtime
	Add TryBox and TryCylinder to ObjToShapeConverter
	

Bugs:
	When entering low-roofed place with very quick crouch-key press then character behaves like standing still
	Executable once locked whole system (needed to cut power to do anything) (in v0.3.1a)
	Sometimes undefined coordinates of player while starting game (randomly) (didn't met since v0.4.1)
	When pressed Exit Game button, game crashed (only one time) (v0.5.0-k)
	When in game pressed ESC, then pressed RMB/LMB and then pressed ESC to return to game, instantly Event spawns multiple boxes/spheres (atleast since v0.5.0-k)
	fprintf(stder,...) in Event::KeyPressedEvent while pressing 'T' to print number of objects in world, crashes since [commit SHA-1: e684b9ee8ba92cc0a29b4ca2e774f0db7ed59098] - temporarilly replaced with std::cout which does not cause problems
	

Removed bugs:
	Removing entity does not remove a ISceneNode
	When resource manager removes a Resource -> destructor is not called
	When starting MainMenu at beginig, simulation is not paused
	Crashed when raytesting for destroying Entities, randomly (v0.5.0-e)
	Very unstable fps (since v0.4.0) - only feeling of game is unstable, but actual frame times are good - corrected in v0.5.0-e by removing smoothing frametime between two frames
	

To test:
	Overall test
	Add many Entities per second and destroy them to find out any memory leaks (valgrind) and memory usage
	

Done tests:
	ResourceManager garbage collector
	JSON wrapper
