Testing/debugging/bugs:
	CollisionShapeConstructor::Clone
	When entering low-roofed place with very short crouch-key press then character behaves like standing still
	Executable once locked whole system (needed to cut power to do anything)
	Sometimes undefined coordinates while starting game (randomly)
	

Features:
	Makefile (and binaries?) for linux
	Saving and loading Entities, SceneNodes, btCollisionObjects, btCollisionShapes from std::iostream
	MotionController steps on staircase or low objects
	Particles
	NavMesh
	

Pre-alpha features:
	Light maps
	Dynamic light maps
	Sound occlusion

Done:
	Using compressed files
	Decoding ogg sound files
	Entity-derived classes and other class reorganisation, move from game\* to engine\*:
		StaticEntity
		DynamicEntity
		Trigger
		CharacterWalkTrigger -> MotionControllerTrigger
		MotionController
	Multiple Entity-derived classes in one module
	Sounds
	Animations
	Loading archives from irrlicht file system
